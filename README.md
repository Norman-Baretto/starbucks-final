# starbucks-final

Using HTML and CSS, I created a clone website of Starbucks, emulating its iconic design and branding. The website features a visually appealing layout with a similar color scheme, typography, and imagery to the original Starbucks website. By carefully crafting the HTML structure and applying CSS styling, I recreated the sections found on the Starbucks site, including the navigation menu, hero banner, product showcases, and footer. Through this project, I aimed to capture the essence of Starbucks' online presence and provide users with a familiar and immersive experience reminiscent of the official website.
